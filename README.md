# seattle_pet_licenses

The city of Seattle makes available its database of pet licenses issued from 2005 to the beginning of 2017 as part of the city's ongoing Open Data Initiative. The data is also obtainable from the Socrata Open Data Access (SODA) portal in either CSV or JSON formats.

This is a primary data visualization practice.
